# thinIt
thinIt is a very basic JavaScript/CSS minifier written in Python 2.7.12.

## Syntax:

`thinit.py [filename] [optional comment text]`

For `filename`, include the path if the file is not in the current directory.  `optional comment text` is used if you want to insert a comment as a first line of the file, for example to include the file name, version number, date, brief description, etc.

Typing `help` as the filename will bring up a brief help screen.
