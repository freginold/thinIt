# thinIt
thinIt is a basic JavaScript/CSS minifier written in Python.

## Syntax:

`thinit.py [filename] ["optional comment text"]`

For `filename`, include the path if the file is not in the current directory (with quotes, if there are spaces).  `optional comment text` is used if you want to insert a comment as the first line of the minified file, for example to include the file name, version number, date, brief description, etc.

Typing `thinit.py help` will bring up a brief help screen.

## Requirements:

- Python 2.7.x
